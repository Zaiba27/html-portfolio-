<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Zaiba Tasneem Edrisi, a final-year BSc IT student at SNDT University, passionate about technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. 
  With a foundation in Python and web technologies, I enjoy exploring the depths of programming and ethical hacking.
   I’ve worked on projects like Gmailsafe, which helped sharpen my practical skills and deepen my understanding of real-world applications.

I’m currently seeking internship opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully, expand my technical expertise, and grow professionally. 
Beyond coding, I’m also deeply committed to personal development, discipline, and balancing my goals with a strong sense of values and purpose.

Let’s build secure, efficient, and innovative digital solutions—one line of code at a time.</p>
